<!--The HTML element is everything from the start tag to the end tag:
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>

Some HTML elements have no content (like the <br> element). These elements are 
called empty elements. 
Empty elements do not have an end tag!

The <html> element is the root element and it defines the whole HTML document.
It has a start tag <html> and an end tag </html>.
Then, inside the <html> element there is a <body> element:
    
The <body> element defines the document's body.
It has a start tag <body> and an end tag </body>.
Then, inside the <body> element there are two other elements: <h1> and <p>:
The <h1> element defines a heading.
It has a start tag <h1> and an end tag </h1>:
The <p> element defines a paragraph.
It has a start tag <p> and an end tag </p>:

HTML tags are not case sensitive: <P> means the same as <p>.
